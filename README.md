## Disclaimer
Command/Control is software meant to only be used on systems you have permission for.  You are responsible for your own local laws and ethics.  Don't be a jerk, keep it legal.

## About
Command/Control is a client and server used for reverse ssh shells.  I wanted to create something that was easy to deploy, easy to use, secure, and had no dependancies.  Bonus points if it has ANSI art.

So here we are.


## Screenshots
Here we can see what the command server looks like when it is first booted up.

In this screenshot we have three connected clients, and have sent a command to client #2.
